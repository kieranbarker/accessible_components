# Accessible components

Dave Rupert's [Nutrition Cards for Accessible Components](https://davatron5000.github.io/a11y-nutrition-cards/) is an attempt to digest and simplify the accessibility expectations when it comes to component authoring, based on the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/) guide.

**This is my attempt to create each of these components from scratch.**
